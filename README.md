Contribution
I have played a key role in writing the system overview for the seat reservation system, which includes problem statements and proposed solution, functional and non-functional requirements. I also did data analysis which includes data flow there results and observation. I also contributed in finding the solution for the challenges we faced and inference and the insight of the code.
